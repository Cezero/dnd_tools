- Do not attempt to run development servers, production servers, or any other server processes
- Do not use `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `pnpm dev`, or similar commands
- If server functionality is needed, ask the user to run the appropriate command themselves
- Focus on code analysis, file editing, and development tasks that don't require running servers
