(18,'Bard','Brd',5,0,1,1,1,'It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience - such is the life of a bard. When chance or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies.\n\nA bard\'s magic comes from the heart. If his heart is good, a bard brings hope and courage to the downtrodden and uses his tricks, music, and magic to thwart the schemes of evildoers. If the nobles of the land are corrupt, the good bard is an enemy of the state, cunningly evading capture and raising the spirits of the oppressed. But music can spring from an evil heart as well. Evil bards forego blatant violence in favor of manipulation, holding sway over the hearts and minds of others and taking what enraptured audiences \"willingly\" give.\n\n**Adventures:** Bards see adventures as opportunities to learn. They practice their many skills and abilities, and they especially relish the opportunity to enter a long-forgotten tomb, to discover ancient works of magic, to decipher old tomes, to travel to strange places, to encounter exotic creatures, and to learn new songs and stories. Bards love to accompany heroes (and villains), joining their entourage to witness their deeds firsthand - a bard who can tell a marvelous story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes doing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.\n\n**Characteristics:** A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use.\n\nIn addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound.\n\nBards have some of the skills that rogues have, although they are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.\n\n**Alignment:** Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment.\n\n**Religion:** Bards revere Fharlanghn (god of roads). They sometimes camp near his wayside shrines, hoping to earn some coin from the travelers who stop to leave offerings for the god. Many bards, even those who are not elves, worship Corellon Larethian, god of elves and patron of poetry and music. Many good bards are partial to Pelor (god of the sun), believing that he watches over them in their travels. Bards given to chaos and occasional larceny favor Olidammara (god of thieves). Those who have turned to evil ways are known to worship Erythnul (the god of slaughter), though few will admit to it. In any event, bards spend so much time on the road that, while they may be devoted to a deity, they are rarely devoted to any particular temple.\n\n**Background:** An apprentice bard learns his skills from a single experienced bard, whom he follows and serves until he is ready to strike out on his own. Many bards were once young runaways or orphans, befriended by wandering bards who became their mentors. Since bards occasionally congregate in informal \"colleges\", the apprentice bard may meet many of the more prominent bards in the area. Still, the bard has no strong allegiance to bards as a whole. In fact, some bards are highly competitive with other bards, jealous of their reputations and defensive about their territories.\n\n**Races:** Bards are commonly human, gnome, elf, or half-elf. Humans take well to the wandering life and adapt easily to new lands and customs. Gnomes have a sense of humor and trickery that lends itself to a bardic career. Elves are talented in music and magic, so the career of the bard comes naturally to them. A bard\'s wandering ways suit many half-elves, who often feel like strangers even when at home. Half-orcs, even those raised among humans, find themselves ill suited to the demands of a bard\'s career. There are no bardic traditions among dwarves, or halflings, though occasional individuals of these races find teachers to train them in the ways of the bard. Bards are exceedingly rare among the savage humanoids, except among centaurs. Centaur bards sometimes train the children of humans or other humanoids.\n\n**Other Classes:** A bard works well with companions of other classes. He often serves as the spokesman of the party, using his social skills for the party\'s benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes his magic. In a party without a rogue, he uses his skills. A bard is curious about the ways of more focused or dedicated adventurers, so he often tries to pick up pointers from fighters, sorcerers, and rogues.\n\n**Role:** The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. He can\'t usually match the stealth of the ranger or the rogue, the spellcasting power of the cleric or the wizard, or the combat prowess of the barbarian or the fighter. However, he makes all the other characters better at what they do, and he can often fill in for another character when needed. For a typical group of four characters, the bard is perhaps the most useful fifth character to consider adding, and he can make a great team leader.',6,6),

(1,'Human',5,1,'Most humans are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, refugees, and other people on the move. As a result, human lands are home to a mix of people-physically, culturally, religiously, and politically different. Hardy or fine, light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or impious, humans run the gamut.\n\n**Personality:** Humans are the most adaptable, flexible, and ambitious people among the common races. They are diverse in their tastes, morals, customs, and habits. Others accuse them of having little respect for history, but it\'s only natural that humans, with their relatively short life spans and constantly changing cultures, would have a shorter collective memory than dwarves, elves, gnomes, or halflings.\n\n**Physical Description:** Humans typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Thanks to their penchant for migration and conquest, and to their short life spans, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. Their skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, their hair from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight), and their facial hair (for men) from sparse to thick. Plenty of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, and they may demonstrate hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Members of this race are often ostentatious or unorthodox in their grooming and dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, body piercings, and the like. Humans reach adulthood around age 15 and have relatively short lifespans, rarely living beyond a single century.\n\n**Relations:** Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mix with members of other races, among which they are known as \"everyone\'s second-best friends.\" Humans serve as ambassadors,diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.\n\n**Alignment:** Humans tend toward no particular alignment, not even neutrality. The best and the worst are found among them.\n\n**Human Lands:** Human lands are usually in flux, with new ideas,social changes, innovations, and new leaders constantly coming to the fore. Members of longer-lived races find human culture exciting but eventually a little wearying or even bewildering.\n\nSince humans lead such short lives, their leaders are all young compared to the political, religious, and military leaders among the other races. Even where individual humans are conservative traditionalists, human institutions change with the generations,adapting and evolving faster than parallel institutions among the elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. Individually and as a group,humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay on top of changing political dynamics.\n\nHuman lands generally include relatively large numbers of nonhumans (compared, for instance, to the number of non-dwarves who live in dwarven lands)\n\n**Religion:** Unlike members of the other common races, humans do not have a chief racial deity. Pelor, the sun god, is the most commonly worshiped deity in human lands, but he can claim nothing like the central place that the dwarves give Moradin or the elves give Corellon Larethian in their respective pantheons. Some humans are the most ardent and zealous adherents of a given religion, while others are the most impious people around \n\n**Language:** Humans speak Common. They typically learn other languages as well, including obscure ones, and they are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elven musical expressions, Dwarven military phrases, and so on.\n\n**Names:** Human names vary greatly. Without a unifying deity to give them a touchstone for their culture, and with such a fast breeding cycle, humans mutate socially at a fast rate. Human culture, therefore, is more diverse than other cultures, and no human names are truly typical. Some human parents give their children dwarven or elven names (pronounced more or less correctly)\n\n**Adventurers:** Human adventurers are the most audacious, daring, and ambitious members of an audacious, daring, and ambitious race. A human can earn glory in the eyes of her fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. Humans, more than other people, champion causes rather than territories or groups.',5,30,-1),
(2,'Dwarf',5,1,'Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishment, their knowledge of the earth\'s secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale Their mysterious kingdoms, carved out from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as gifts or for trade.\n\n**Personality:** Dwarves are slow to laugh or jest and suspicious of strangers, but they are generous to those few who earn their trust. Dwarves value gold, gems, jewelry, and art objects made with these precious materials, and they have been known to succumb to greed. They fight neither recklessly nor timidly, but with a careful courage and tenacity. Their sense of justice is strong, but at its worst it can turn into a thirst for vengeance. Among gnomes, who get along famously with dwarves, a mild oath is “If I’m lying, may I cross a dwarf.\"\n\n**Physical Description:** Dwarves stand only 4 to 4-1/2 feet tall, but they are so broad and compact that they are, on average, almost as heavy as humans. Dwarf men are slightly taller and noticeably heavier than dwarf women. Dwarves skin is typically deep tan or light brown and their eyes are dark.Their hair is usually black,gray, or brown, and worn long. Dwarf men value their beards highly and groom themvery carefully. Dwarves favor simple styles for their hair, beards, and clothes. Dwarves are considered adults at about age 40, and they can live to be more than 400 years old.\n\n**Relations:** Dwarves get along fine with gnomes, and passably with humans, half-elves, and halflings. Dwarves say, The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years.\'Humans, with their short life spans, have a hard time forging truly strong bonds with dwarves. The best dwarf-human friendships are between a human and a dwarf who liked the human\'s parents and grandparents. Dwarves fail to appreciate elves subtlety and art,regarding elves as unpredictable, fickle, and flighty. Still, elves and dwarves have, through the ages, found common cause in battles against orcs, goblins, and gnolls. Through many such joint campaigns, the elves have earned the dwarves\' grudging respect.Dwarves mistrust half-orcs in general, and the feeling is mutual.Luckily, dwarves are fair-minded, and they grant individual half-orcs the opportunity to prove themselves.\n\n**Alignment:** Dwarves are usually lawful, and they tend toward good. Adventuring dwarves are less likely to fit the common mold,however, since they\'re more likely to be those who did not fit perfectly into dwarven society.\n\n**Dwarven Lands:** Dwarven kingdoms usually lie deep beneath the stony faces of mountains, where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in such settlements, though some parts of these lands are off limits even to them. Whatever wealth the dwarves can\'t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. Dwarves dislike water travel, so enterprising humans frequently handle trade in dwarven goods when travel is along a water route.\n\nDwarves in human lands are typically mercenaries, weaponsmiths, armorsmiths, jewelers, and artisans. Dwarf bodyguards are renowned for their courage and lovalty, and they are well rewarded for their virtues.\n\n**Religion:** The chief deity of the dwarves is Moradin, the Soul Forger. He is the creator of the dwarves, and he expects his followers to work for the betterment of the dwarf race.\n\n**Language:** Dwarves speak Dwarven, which has its own runic script. Dwarven literature is marked by comprehensive histories of kingdoms and wars through the millennia.The Dwarven alphabet is also used (with minor variations) for the Gnome, Giant,Goblin, Orc, and Terran languages. Dwarves often speak the languages of their friends (humans and gnomes) and enemies. Some also learn Terran, the strange language of earth-based creatures such as xorn.\n\n**Names:** A dwarf\'s name is granted to him by his clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name is not his own. It belongs to his clan. If he misuses it or brings shame to it, his clan will strip him of it. A dwarf stripped of his name is forbidden by dwarven law to use any dwarven name in its place.\n\n**Male Names:** Barendd, Brottor, Eberk, Einkil, Oskar, Rurik, Taklinn, Torderk, Traubon, Ulfgar, Veit.\n\n**Female Names:** Artin, Audhild, Dagnal, Diesa, Gunnloda, Hlin, Ilde, Liftrasa, Sannl, Torgga\n\n**Clan Names:** Balderk, Dankil, Gorunn, Holderhek, Loderr, Lutgehr, Rumnaheim, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart.\n\n**Adventurers:** A dwarven adventurer may be motivated by crusading zeal, a love of excitement, or simple greed. As long as his accomplishments bring honor to his clan, his deeds earn him respect and status. Defeating giants and claiming powerful magic weapons are sure ways for a dwarf to earn the respect of other dwarves,',5,20,21),
(3,'Elf',5,1,'Elves mingle freely in human lands, always welcome yet never at home there. They are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favor things of natural and simple beauty.When danger threatens their woodland homes, however, elves reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and battle strategy.\n\n**Personality:** Elves are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. With such a long life span, they tend to keep a broad perspective on events, remaining aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether an adventurous mission or learning a new skill or art, they can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance \n\n**Physical Description:** Elves are short and slim, standing about 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 feet tall and typically weighing 95 to 135 pounds, with elf men the same height as and only marginally heavier than elf women. They are graceful but frail. They tend to be pale-skinned and dark-haired, with deep green eyes. Elves have no facial or body hair. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes, especially in pastel blues and greens, and they enjoy simple yet elegant jewelry. Elves possess unearthly grace and fine features. Many humans and members of other races find them hauntingly beautiful. An elf reaches adulthood at about 110 vears of age and can live to be more than 700 vears old.\n\nElves do not sleep, as members of the other common races do. Instead, an elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day. An elf resting in this fashion gains the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. While meditating, an elf dreams, though these dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. The Common word for an elf\'s meditation is \"trance\", as in \"four hours of trance.\"\n\n**Relations:** Elves consider humans rather unrefined, halflings a bit staid, gnomes somewhat trivial, and dwarves not at all fun. They look on half-elves with some degree of pity, and they regard half-orcs with unrelenting suspicion. While haughty. elves are not particular the way halflings and dwarves can be, and they are generally pleasant and gracious even to those who fall short of elven standards (a category that encompasses just about everybody who\'s not an elf).\n\n**Alignment:** Since elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. Generally, they value and protect others\' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.\n\n**Elven Lands:** Most elves live in woodland clans numbering less than two hundred souls. Their well-hidden villages blend into the trees, doing little harm to the forest. They hunt game, gather food and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allowing them to support themselves amply without the need for clearing and plowing land. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though some few elves make a good living trading finely worked elven clothes and crafts for the metals that elves have no interest in mining.\n\nElves encountered in human lands are commonly wandering minstrels, favored artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors, who teach swordplay to their children.\n\n**Religion:** Above all others, elves worship Corellon Larethian, the Protector and Preserver of life. Elven myth holds that it was from his blood, shed in battles with Gruumsh, the god of the orcs, that the elves first arose. Corellon is a patron of magical study, arts, dance,and poetry, as well as a powerful warrior god.\n\n**Language:** Elves speak a fluid language of subtle intonations and intricate grammar. While Elven literature is rich and varied, it is the language\'s songs and poems that are most famous. Many bards learn Elven so they can add Elven ballads to their repertoires. Others simply memorize Elven songs by sound. The Elven script, as flowing as the spoken word, also serves as the script for Sylvan, the language of dryads and pixies, for Aquan, the language of water-based creatures, and for Undercommon, the language of the drow and other subterranean creatures.\n\n**Names:** When an elf declares herself an adult, usually some time after her hundredth birthday, she also selects a name. Those who knew her as a youngster may or may not continue to call her by her child name, and she may or may not care. An elf\'s adult name is a unique creation, though it may reflect the names of those she admires or the names of others in her family. In addition, she bears her family name. Family names are combinations of regular Elven words: and some elves traveling among humans translate their names into Common while others use the Elven version.\n\n**Male Names:** Aramil, Aust, Enialis, Heian, Himo, Ivellios, Laucian, Quarion, Soverliss, Thamior, Tharivol.\n\n**Female Names:** Anastrianna, Antinua, Drusilia, Felosial, Ielenia,Lia, Mialee, Qillathe, Silaqui, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia.\n\n**Family Names (Common Translations):** Amastacia (Starflower), Amakiir (Gemflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nailo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Ilphukiir (Gemblossom), Xiloscient (Goldpetal).\n\n**Adventurers:** Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Life among humans moves at a pace that elves dislike: regimented from day to day but changing from decade to decade. Elves among humans, therefore, find careers that allow them to wander freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy demonstrating their prowess with the sword and bow or gaining greater magical powers, and adventuring allows them to do so. Good elves may also be rebels or crusaders.',5,30,27),
(4,'Gnome',5,1,'Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills where animals abound.\n\n**Personality:** Gnomes adore animals, beautiful gems, and jokes of all kinds. Members of this race have a great sense of humor, and while they love puns, jokes, and games, they relish tricks - the more intricate the better. They apply the same dedication to more practical arts, such as engineering, as they do to their pranks.\n\nGnomes are inquisitive. They love to find things out by personal experience. At times they\'re even reckless. Their curiosity makes them skilled engineers, since they are always trying new ways to build things. Sometimes a gnome pulls a prank just to see how the people involved will react.\n\n**Physical Description:** Gnomes stand about 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, and they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.\n\n**Relations:** Gnomes get along well with dwarves, who share their love of precious objects, their curiosity about mechanical devices, and their hatred of goblins and giants. They enjoy the company of halflings, especially those who are easygoing enough to put up with pranks and jests. Most gnomes are a little suspicious of the taller races - humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs - but they are rarely hostile or malicious.\n\n**Alignment:** Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or consultants. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious. Evil gnomes are as rare as they are frightening.\n\n**Gnome Lands:** Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden, by both clever construction and illusions, Those who come to visit and are welcome are ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome never find the burrows in the first place.\n\nGnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, mechanics, sages, or tutors. Some human families retain gnome tutors. During his life, a gnome tutor can teach several generations of a single human family.\n\n**Religion:** The chief gnome god is Garl Glittergold, the Watchful Protector. His clerics teach that gnomes are to cherish and support their communities. Pranks are seen as ways to lighten spirits and to keep gnomes humble, not as ways for pranksters to triumph over those they trick.\n\n**Language:** The Gnome language, which uses the Dwarven script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world. Human herbalists, naturalists, and engineers commonly learn Gnome in order to read the best books on their topics of study.\n\n**Names:** Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. As a gnome grows up, his mother gives him a name, his father gives him a name, his clan elder gives him a name, his aunts and uncles give him names, and he gains nicknames from just about anyone. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are rather stuffy about names, a gnome learns to act as if he has no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname. When deciding which of his several names to use among humans, a gnome generally chooses the one that\'s the most fun to say. Gnome clan names are combinations of common Gnome words, and gnomes almost always translate them into Common when in human lands (or into Elven when in elven lands, and so on)\n\n**Male Names:** Boddynock, Dimble, Fonkin, Gimble, Glim, Gerbo, Jebeddo, Namfoodle, Roondar, Seebo, Zook.\n\n**Female Names:** Bimpnottin, Caramip, Duvamil, Ellywick, Ellyjobell, Loopmottin, Mardnab, Roywyn, Shamil, Waywocket.\n\n**Clan Names:** Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Turen.\n\n**Nicknames:** Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Oneshoe, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck \n\n**Adventurers:** Gnomes are curious and impulsive. They may take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. Lawful gnomes may adventure to set things right and to protect the innocent, demonstrating the same sense of duty toward society as a whole that gnomes generally exhibit toward their own enclaves. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Depending on his relations to his home clan, an adventuring gnome may be seen as a vagabond or even something of a traitor (for abandoning clan responsibilities).',4,20,18),
(5,'Half-Elf',5,1,'Humans and elves sometimes wed, the elf attracted to the human\'s energy and the human to the elf\'s grace. These marriages end quickly as elves count years because a human\'s life is so brief, but they leave an enduring legacy - half-elf children.\n\nThe life of a half-elf can be hard. If raised by elves, the half-elf seems to grow with astounding speed, reaching maturity within two decades. The half-elf becomes an adult long before she has had time to learn the intricacies of elven art and culture, or even grammar. She leaves behind her childhood friends, becoming physically an adult but culturally still a child by elven standards. Typically, she leaves her elven home, which is no longer familiar, and finds her way among humans.\n\nIf, on the other hand, she is raised by humans, the half-elf finds herself different from her peers: more aloof, more sensitive, less ambitious, and slower to mature. Some half-elves try to fit in among humans, while others find their identities in their difference. Most find places for themselves in human lands, but some feel like outsiders all their lives.\n\n**Personality:** Most half-elves have the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of the human parent, along with the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elf parent \n\n**Physical Description:** To humans half-elves look like elves. To elves, they look like humans - indeed, elves call them half-humans. Half-elf height ranges from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and weight usually ranges from 100 to 180 pounds. Half-elf men are taller and heavier than half-elf women, but the difference is less pronounced than that found among humans. Half-elves are paler, fairer, and smoother-skinned than their human parents, but their actual skin tone, hair color, and other details vary just as human features do. Half-elves eyes are green, just as are those of their elf parents. A half-elf reaches adulthood at age 20 and can live to be over 180 years old.\n\nMost half-elves are the children of human-elf pairings. Some, however, are the children of parents who themselves are partly human and partly elf. Some of these second generation half-elves have humanlike eyes, but most still have green eyes.\n\n**Relations:** Half-elves do well among both elves and humans, and they also get along well with dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. They have elven grace without elven aloofness, human energy without human boorishness. They make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other). In human lands where elves are distant or not on friendly terms with other races, however, half-elves are viewed with suspicion.\n\nSome half-elves show a marked disfavor toward half-orcs. Perhaps the similarities between themselves and half-orcs (a partly human lineage) makes these half-elves uncomfortable.\n\n**Alignment:** Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage, but, like humans, they tend toward both good and evil in equal proportion. Like elves, they value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.\n\n**Half-Elven Lands:** Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and elven forests. In large cities, half-elves sometimes form small communities of their own.\n\n**Religion:** Half-elves raised among elves follow elven deities, principally Corellon Larethian (god of the elves). Those raised among humans often follow Ehlonna (goddess of the woodlands).\n\n**Language:** Half-elves speak the languages they are born to, Common and Elven. Half-elves are slightly clumsy with the intricate Elven language, though only elves notice, and even so half-elves do better than nonelves.\n\n**Names:** Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. Ironically, a half-elf raised among humans is often given an elven name in honor of her heritage, just as a half-elf raised among elves often takes a human name.\n\n**Adventurers:** Half-elves find themselves drawn to strange careers and unusual company. Taking up the life of an adventurer comes easily to many of them. Like elves, they are driven by wanderlust.',5,30,-1),
(6,'Half-Orc',5,1,'In the wild frontiers, tribes of human and orc barbarians live in uneasy balance, fighting in times of war and trading in times of peace. Half-orcs who are born in the frontier may live with either human or orc parents, but they are nevertheless exposed to both cultures. Some, for whatever reason, leave their homeland and travel to civilized lands, bringing with them the tenacity, courage, and combat prowess that they developed in the wilds.\n\n**Personality:** Half-orcs tend to be short-tempered and sullen. They would rather act than ponder and would rather fight than argue. Those who are successful, however, are those with enough self-control to live in a civilized land, not the crazy ones.\n\nHalf-orcs love simple pleasures such as feasting, drinking, boasting, singing, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing. Refined enjoyments such as poetry, courtly dancing, and philosophy are lost on them. At the right sort of party, a half-orc is an asset. At the duchess\'s grand ball, he\'s a liability.\n\n**Physical Description:** Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds. A half-orc\'s grayish pigmentation, sloping forehead, jutting jaw, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair make his lineage plain for all to see.\n\nOrcs like scars. They regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of shame indicating servitude and identifying the half-orc\'s former owner, or marks of pride recounting conquests and high status. Such a half-orc living among humans may either display or hide his scars, depending on his attitude toward them.\n\nHalf-orcs mature a little faster than humans and age noticeably faster. They reach adulthood at age 14, and few live longer than 75 years.\n\n**Relations:** Because orcs are the sworn enemies of dwarves and elves, half-orcs can have a rough time with members of these races. For that matter, orcs aren\'t exactly on good terms with humans,halflings, or gnomes, either. Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate or fear his orc cousins. Some half orcs are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). Others simply try to be so tough that others have no choice but to accept them.\n\n**Alignment:** Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents, but, like their human parents, they favor good and evil in equal proportions. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives with them are usually the evil ones.\n\n**Half-Orc Lands:** Half-orcs have no  lands of their own, but they most  often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are the ones most likely to accept half-orcs and half-orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes.\n\n**Religion:** Like orcs many half-orcs worship Gruumsh, the chief orc god and archenemy of Corellon Larethian, god of the elves. While Gruumsh is evil, half-orc barbarians and fighters may worship him as a war god even if they are not evil themselves. Worshipers of Gruumsh who are tired of explaining themselves, or who don’t want to give humans a reason to distrust them simply don\'t make their religion public knowledge. Half-orcs who want to solidify their connection to their human heritage, on the other hand, follow human gods, and they may be outspoken in their shows of piety.\n\n**Language:** Orc, which has no alphabet of its own, uses Dwarven script on the rare occasions that someone writes something down. Orc writing turns up most frequently in graffiti.\n\n**Names:** A half-orc typically chooses a name that helps him make the impression that he wants to make. If he wants to fit in among humans, he chooses a human name. If he wants to intimidate others, he chooses a guttural orc name. A half-orc who has been raised entirely by humans has a human given name, but he may choose another name once he’s away from his hometown. Some half-orcs, of course, aren\'t quite bright enough to choose a name this carefully.\n\n**Orc Male Names:** Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Ront, Shump, Thokk.\n\n**Orc Female Names:** Baggi, Emen, Engong, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Vola, Volen.\n\n**Adventurers:** Half-orcs living among humans are drawn almost invariably toward violent careers in which they can put their strength to good use. Frequently shunned from polite company, half-orcs often find acceptance and friendship among adventurers, many of whom are fellow wanderers and outsiders.',5,30,17),
(7,'Halfling',5,1,'Halflings are clever, capable opportunists. Halfling individuals and clans find room for themselves wherever they can. Often they are strangers and wanderers, and others react to them with suspicion or curiosity. Depending on the clan, halflings might be reliable, hard-working (if clannish) citizens, or they might be thieves just waiting for the opportunity to make a big score and disappear in the dead of night. Regardless, halflings are cunning, resourceful survivors.\n\n**Personality:** Halflings prefer trouble to boredom. They are notoriously curious. Relying on their ability to survive or escape danger, they demonstrate a daring that many larger people cant match. Halflings clans are nomadic, wandering wherever circumstance and curiosity take them. Halflings enjoy wealth quickland the plsure it can brin, and they tend to spend gold as quickly as they acquire it.\n\nHalflings are also famous collectors. While more orthodox halflings may collect weapons, books, or jewelry, some collect such objects as the hides of wild beasts - or even the beasts themselves. Wealthy halflings sometimes commission adventurers to retrieve exotic items to complete their collections.\n\n**Physical Description:** Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. Their skin is ruddy, their hair black and straight. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. They like to wear simple, comfortable and practical clothes. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of her second century.\n\n**Relations:** Halflings try to get along with everyone else. They are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, elves, or gnomes and making themselves valuable and welcome. Since human society changes faster than the societies of the longer-lived races, it is human society that most frequently offers halflings opportunities to exploit, and halflings are most often found in or around human lands.\n\n**Alignment:** Halflings tend to be neutral. While they are comfortable with change (a chaotic trait) they also tend to rely on intangible constants, such as clan ties and personal honor (a lawful trait).\n\n**Halfling Lands:** Halflings have no lands of their own. Instead, they live in the lands of other races, where they can benefit from whatever resources those lands have to offer. Halflings often form tight-knit communities in human or dwarven cities. While they work readily with others, they often make friends only their own kind. Halflings also settle into secluded places where they set up self-reliant villages. Halfling communities, however, are known for picking up and moving en masse to some place that offers a new opportunity, such as a new mine that has just opened, or to a land where a devastating war has made skilled workers hard to find. If these opportunities are temporary, the community may pick up and move again once the opportunity is gone, or once a better one presents itself. Some halfling communities, on the other hand, take to traveling as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place, and maintaining no permanent home.\n\n**Religion:** The chief halfling deity is Yondalla, the Blessed One, protector of the halflings. Yondalla promises blessings and protection to those who heed her guidance, defend their clans, and cherish their families. Halflings also recognize countless small gods, which they say rule over individual villages, forests, rivers, lakes, and so on. They pay homage to these deities to ensure safe journeys as they travel from place to place.\n\n**Language:** Halflings speak their own language, which uses the Common script. They write very little in their own language so, unlike dwarves, elves, and gnomes they don\'t  have a rich body of written work. The halfling oral tradition, however, is very strong. While the Halfling language isn’t secret, halflings are loath to share it with others. Almost all halflings speak Common, since they use it to deal with the people in whose land they are living or through are traveling.\n\n**Names:** halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. It would seem that family names are nothing more than nicknames that stuck so well they have been passed down through the generations.\n\n**Male Names:** Alton, Beau, Cade, Eldon, Garret, Lyle, Milo, Osborn, Roscoe, Wellby. \n\n**Female Names:** Amaryllis, Charmaine, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Portia, Seraphina, Verna.\n\n**Family Names:** Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, Highhill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough.\n\n**Adventurers:** Halflings often set out on their own to make their way in the world. Halfling adventurers are typically looking for a way to use their skills to gain wealth or status. The distinction between a halfling adventurer and a halfling out on her own looking for \"a big score\" can get blurry. For a halfling, adventuring is less of a career than an opportunity. While halfling opportunism can sometimes look like larceny or fraud to others, a halfling adventurer who learns to trust her fellows is worthy of trust in return.',4,20,25);

(For a common or well-known item, your chance of estimating the value within 10% is fairly high even if you fail the check - in such a case, you made a lucky guess.)\n\nAppraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value.\n\nA magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem.

A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:\n[Table: balancesurface]\n[Table: balancenarrowmods]\n\n*Being Attacked while Balancing:* You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can’t move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren’t considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to\nremain standing.\n\n*Accelerated Movement:* You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action\nused.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious\nsurface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or\nfraction thereof) that you charge','None. A Balance check doesn’t require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.',0,'','If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.','If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.','',1,'You can keep your balance while walking on a tightrope, a narrow beam, a slippery ledge, or an uneven floor.',0),
(3,'Bluff',NULL,6,'A Bluff check is opposed by the target’s Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target’s Sense Motive check for each one.\n[Table: bluffexamples]\n\nFavorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its selfinterest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it’s important, the DM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn’t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff (and would have done so even if that bluff had not entailed any demand).\n\nA successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. For example, you could use bluff to put a shopkeeper off guard by saying that his shoes are untied. At best, such a bluff would make the shopkeeper glance down at his shoes. It would not cause him to ignore you and fiddle with his shoes.\n\nA bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.\n\n*Feinting in Combat:* You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.\n\nFeinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.\n\nFeinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n\n*Creating a Diversion to Hide:* You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.\n\nThis usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n\n*Delivering a Secret Message:* You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. Two rogues, for example, might seem to be talking about bakery goods when they’re really planning how to break into the evil wizard’s laboratory. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see [Skill: Sense Motive]).','Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn’t take an action; it is part of normal communication. However, the DM may limit the amount of information you can convey in a single round.',1,'Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round. Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.','A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.\n\nThe master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.\n\nIf you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.','If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you’re being observed and you try to act in character.','',0,'You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible, or use doublespeak or innuendo to deliver a secret message to another character. The skill encompasses acting, conning, fast talking, misdirection, prevarication, and misleading body language. Use a bluff to sow temporary confusion, get someone to turn and look where you point, or simply look innocuous.',0),
(4,'Climb',NULL,1,'With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.\n\nA Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.\n\nA climber’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.\n\nThe DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.\n[Table: climbbasedc]\n\n[Table: climbdcmods]\n\nYou need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can’t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can’t use a shield while climbing.\n\nAny time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has information on falling damage.)\n\n*Accelerated Climbing:* You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a –5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).\n\n*Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:* You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.\n\n*Catching Yourself When Falling:* It’s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 20) to do so. It’s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope’s DC + 10).\n\n*Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:* If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.','Climbing is part of movement, so it’s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn’t take an action.',0,'','You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.\n\nA halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.\n\nThe master of a lizard familiar (see the Familiars sidebar, page 52) gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.\n\nIf you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.\n\nA creature with a climb speed (such as a monstrous spider, or a character under the effect of a spider climb spell) has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 (see Checks without Rolls), even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.','If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.','',1,'Use this skill to scale a cliff, to get to the window on the second story of a wizard’s tower, or to climb out of a pit after falling through a trapdoor.',0),
(5,'Craft',NULL,4,'You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)\n\nThe basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. (In the game world, is it the skill level required, the time required, and the raw materials required that determine an item’s price.)\n\nIn some cases, the [Spell: fabricate] spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and so forth).\n\nA successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell (page 246) enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.\n\nWhen casting the spell [Spell: minor creation], you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. For instance, a successful Craft (bowmaking) check might be required to make straight arrow shafts.\n\nAll crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.\n\nTo determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.\n1. Find the item’s price in Chapter 7: Equipment of this book or in\nthe Dungeon Master’s Guide, or have the DM set the price for an item\nnot otherwise described. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).\n2. Find the DC from the table below, or have the DM set one.\n3. Pay one-third of the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.\n4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.\n\nIf you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.\n\n*Progress by the Day:* You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.\n\n*Creating Masterwork Items:* You can make a masterwork item - a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.\n\n*Repairing Items:* Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.\n\nWhen you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.\n\n[Table: craftitemdc]\n','Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).',1,'Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.','A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.\n\nA gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive noses.\n\nYou may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.\n\nTo make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.','If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.','',0,'You are trained in a craft, trade, or art, such as alchemy, armorsmithing, basketweaving, bookbinding, bowmaking, blacksmithing, calligraphy, carpentry, cobbling, gemcutting, leatherworking, locksmithing, painting, pottery, sculpting, shipmaking, stonemasonry, trapmaking, weaponsmithing, or weaving.\n\nLike Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. For instance, you could have the skill Craft (carpentry). Your ranks in that skill don’t affect any Craft (pottery) or Craft (leatherworking) checks you might make. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.\n\nA Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something.

The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker\'s normal speed.\nA strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM\'s option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.\nShould the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effecttively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.\nYou can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air.

The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.\nYou retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack). You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian\'s rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon\'s frightful presence ability).\nIf the new form is capable of speech,you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.\nYou acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.\nYou do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.\nYou do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn\'t change the creature type or subtype.\nYou can freely designate the new form\'s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form\'s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under vour control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form\'s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form\'s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.\nWhen the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can\'t wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

This alteration changes each animal\'s size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2hit points per HD), and imposes a 2 size penalty to Dexterity.The creature\'s existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal\'s modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 22 in the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. The animal\'s space and reach change as indicated on Table 84: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change. The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4resistance bonus on saving throws, If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing itthe spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell,though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature\'s possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things that you can\'t use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that\'s still under the effect of the first casting.','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','1 min','Fort neg','Yes',5,4,NULL,NULL),

The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else,including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you.It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain). The directions must be simple,because the animal depends on your knowledge and can\'t find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it\'s written in a language he or she doesn\'t know, for example).

In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.

The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected. For example, if Vadania affects 7 HD worth of animals and there are several 2 HD wolves within close range, only the three closest wolves are affected A magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not.','1sa','Close',3,NULL,'','[c]','Will neg*','Yes',5,2,NULL,NULL),

The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature)entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroved. A destroved skeleton or zombie can\'t be animated again.) Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can\'t create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead. (The desecrate spell doubles this limit, see page 218.) The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell. however.you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.(You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a cleric.any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton.The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example,is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size;they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons. Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie.The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies. Material Component You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate.

A Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants,a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. Use the statistics for animated objects found in the Monster Manual, except that plants smaller than Large don\'t have hardness unless the DM rules otherwise for a given case. Animate plants cannot affect plant creatures (such as treants), nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material (such as a cotton tunic or hempen rope). Entangle: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area.

The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter.Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope\'s diameter by half. The possible commands are coil (form a neat, coiled stack), coil and knot, *loop,loop and knot, tie and knot, and the opposites of all of the above (uncoil, and so forth).You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it-it does not snake outward-so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concen tration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical. This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.

(82,'Antimagic Field','Negates magic within 10 ft.','An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities,and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into,or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the sup.pressed spell\'s duration. Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature\'s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one,for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter selfsupporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.These creatures spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force,prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. See the Dungeon Master\'s Guide for more about artifacts.)

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.

These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.\n\nYou project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.\n\nWhile you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master\'s Guide for more information.) When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\n\nYou and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane which kills you).\n\n**Material Component** A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.','30 mins','Touch',1,NULL,'','see text','None','Yes',5,9,NULL,NULL),
(123,'Atonement','Removes burden of misdeeds from subject.','This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject\'s burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest see geas/quest or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf. Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points. Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil,good, chaotic, or lawful. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs). This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly,and definitively. Material Component Burning incense. Focus In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.

For example if a character is considering destroying a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury might determine whether that act is a good idea. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%;the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: Weal if the action will probably bring good results). Woe (for bad results Weal and woe (for both). Nothing for actions that don\'t have especially good or bad results), If the spell fails, you get the nothing result. A cleric who gets the *nothing result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result.Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.

This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain berween the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it,providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility,polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however. A Bigby\'s hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you\'re undamaged, and its AC is 20 (1size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don\'t cause damage do not affect it.The hand never provokes attacks of op.portunity from opponents. It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it suffers the full effect of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster.Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. Any creature weighing 2,o00 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed.

(196,'Binding','Utilizes an array of techniques to imprison a creature.','A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half vour caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal,dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant\'s level, provided that the spell\'s target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\'s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\'t qualify. For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell\'s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken The binding spell has six versions.Choose one of the following versions when vou cast the spell. Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell\'s save DC by 1. Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container,which may be transparent if you so choose.The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed,nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.Reduce the save DC by 4. You can\'t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen\'s disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect Components The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used.These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like. In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.','1 min','Close',3,NULL,'','see text(D)','Will neg*','Yes',5,8,NULL,NULL),

(249,'Blink','You randomly vanish and reappear for 1 rounds.','Like a blink dog (see the Monster Manual),you blink back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you\'re winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random. Blinking has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50%miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn\'t help opponents, since you\'re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures,the miss chance is only 20% (for conceal ment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against vou while vou\'re blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.) Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally,Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can\'t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.','1sa','Personal',2,NULL,'','1 rd(D)','','',5,3,NULL,NULL),

For example,a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.

Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item\'s saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master\'s Guide.) An item in a creature\'s possession uses the creature\'s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding,touching, wearing, or carrving metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2points; see the table if it\'s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it\'s carry.ing weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell\'s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third,fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below. <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><html><body><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td>Round</td><td>Metal Temperature</td><td>Damage</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Cold</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Icy</td><td>1d4 points</td></tr><tr><td>3-5</td><td>Freezing</td><td>2d4 points</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Icy</td><td>1d4 points</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Cold</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html></div> Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.

The original\'s physical remains,should they still exist,become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails. To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature\'s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the gentle repose spell).Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When the clone is completed, the original\'s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character).

Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell\'s area. A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions. An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the cye in the center. + A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other. Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. (The categories of wind strength are briefly described below,with more detail to be found in the Dungeon Master\'s Guide.) Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage. A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

(696,'Dispel Magic','Cancels magical spells and effects with dispell check of 1d20+1.','Because magic is so powerful, so too is the ability to dispel magic. You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster\'s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions cant be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel but not counter) spell like effects just as it does spells. Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can\'t be dispelled,because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.Thus, you cant use dispel magic to repair damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake. You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel,or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell You make a dispel check 1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11+ the spell\'s caster level. For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a drow who is under the effects of haste, mage arnor, and bull\'s strength. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor,and bull\'s strength effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow\'s spell resistance doesn\'t help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item\'s caster level. If vou succeed, all the item\'s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item\'s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Area Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way,the spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature\'s magic items are not affected. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect,but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\'s spell.','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','Inst','None','No',5,3,NULL,NULL),

You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it,nor can it communicate with you telepathically Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping,eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25)can determine that the subject\'s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description, page 81). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can\'t communicate with you. You can\'t actually see through the subject\'s eyes, so it\'s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what\'s going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard,the guard looks suspicious, and so forth). Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive or ders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.If you don\'t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it','1r','Close',3,NULL,'','1 days','Will neg','Yes',5,4,NULL,NULL),

The effect lasts for 1round, during which time creatures on the ground can\'t move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures,and creatures in the area.The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%chance to fall into one Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure), At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within. Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage,enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is See the Dungeon Master\'s Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned beneath Rubble Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.','1sa','Long',5,NULL,'','1 rd','see text','No',5,7,NULL,NULL),

This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell-an enlarged +sword still has only a +1 enhancement bonus, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giantsized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate,and so on. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means among other things) that you can\'t use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of a humanoid that\'s still under the effect of the first casting. Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person. Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round.Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell (see the Dungeon Master\'s Guide for information about NPC attitudes). Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing,to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling.For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist (as described in Aid Another, page 65). The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you.

As an insubstantial creature,you can move through solid objects,including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.

Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6),divided up among the acorns as you wish.For example, a 2oth-level druid could create one 20d6 missile, two 10d6 missiles one 11d6 and three 3d6 missiles, or any other combination totalling up to four acorns and 20d6 points of damage. Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand,since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons(they can be tossed only 5feet).

This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).

When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.

Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam. You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specificallv attuned when cast.

A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must *hit the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

Its material armor (including natural armor)becomes worthless, though its size,Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (for example from the mage armor spell) still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can\'t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.) The subject also loses super natural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can\'t run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can\'t enter water or other liquid. It also can\'t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form.Continuously active items remain active though in some cases their effects may be moot (such as those that supply armor or natural armor bonuses).

(1026,'Gate','Connects two planes for travel or summoning.','Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster\'s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you. It is a twodimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel,a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire a creation effect)Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You could position a gate in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane.Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect. By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below). If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual-for in stance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrinyou may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can\'t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases,making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature\'s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards.Some creatures may want their payment in livestock rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to vour vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master,at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire,good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon. XP Cost 1,00o XP (only for the calling creatures function).','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','Special','None','No',5,9,NULL,NULL),
(1027,'Geas, Lesser','Commands subject of 7 HD or less.','A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by vou. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some openended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions (such as Wait here or Defend this area against attack), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell. If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a 2penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another 2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of 8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas. A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break cnchantment,limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.','1r','Close',3,NULL,'','1 days*','Will neg','Yes',5,3,NULL,NULL),
(1028,'Geas/Quest','As lesser geas, plus it affects any creature.','This spell functions similarly to lesser geas,except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw. Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/ quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do. Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics cal the same spell quest.','10 mins','Close',3,NULL,'','1 days*','None','Yes',5,6,NULL,NULL),

The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.

(1070,'Glyph of Warding','Inscription harms those who pass it.','This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type,subtype, or kind (such as aberration, drow,or red dragon). Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level.Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area.However, if a cabinet has three drawers,each can be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing,though they can be dispelled. Mislead, poly.morph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can\'t. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check.Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused,what spell is stored). The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to you depend on your deity. He or she might also make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules in the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected,a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold,fire, electricity, or sonic (caster\'s choice,made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know.All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10Balance check. Failure means it can\'t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls see the Balance skill for details). The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance.For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect,but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item-a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance.Material objects not in use are always af fected by this spell, while an object wielded or emploved by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallow again.

If. at the end of 4 hours of searching,the hand has found no subiect that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.Light, however, never becomes invisible,although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe.Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character\'s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat,climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth.If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 85: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.

Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area.

Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells.','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','Inst*','None','No',5,2,NULL,NULL),

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating,sleeping, and so forth. When completed,the divination brings legends (if any)about the person, place, or things to your mind.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75%chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,ooo gp.Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time-even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on just as any normal chest can be. To hide the chest,you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwiseit is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants), The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnishings-eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. Material Component A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood.

(1439,'Magic Circle against Evil','As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 minutes.','All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can.enter the area either. You must overcome a creature\'s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle\'s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\'s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness,gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature\'s extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks ranged weapons, spells magical abilities, and the like can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a twodimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure.Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. The DM makes this check secretly. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.This task also takes 10full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagrameven a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protertion from evil and vice versa. Arcane Material Component A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground)around the creature to be warded.','1sa','Touch',1,NULL,'','10 min','Will neg(h)','No*',5,2,NULL,NULL),

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar.You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence), You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot deter mine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces,you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls. For example,if rwo 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD) you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy.You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature,but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a fullround action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature\'s soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host\'s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence,Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abi lities, and automatic abilities. For example,a fishs body breathes water and a troll\'s body regenerates. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can\'t choose to activate the body\'s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature\'s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range,sending the trapped soul back to its body.The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host\'s location.

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does.however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue,the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired.although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: Speak onlv when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says Boo). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example,Speak when any creature touches the statue is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject\'s actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature\'s natural inclinations.

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature\'s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies,protect us on our foray into the dungeon).You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature\'s alignment and goals. Regardless,this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services.The bargaining takes at least 1 round,so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift.Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed,unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the crea ture\'s ethos,the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value. At the end of its task.or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible) Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good,lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual\'s proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature\'s Charisma check.The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check,the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions such as Wait here or Defend this area against attack), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example,lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.','10 mins','Close*',3,NULL,'','Inst','Will neg','No, Yes*',5,3,NULL,NULL),

(1720,'Polymorph Any Object','Changes any subject into anything else.','This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines. <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><html><body><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>Changed Subject Is:</td><td>Increaseto Duration Factor</td></tr><tr><td>Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral)</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Same size</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.)</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Same or lower Intelligence</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>1 Add all that apply.

If the original form didn\'t have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the poly.morphed creature. For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage,perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed. Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide.In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force,although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren\'t affected by this spell. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver,gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh transmute mud to rock. transmute water to dust, or transmute rock to mud.

A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. *Prestidigitation* can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a *prestidigitation* spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a *prestidigitation* lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.\n\nCharacters typically use *prestidigitation* spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with *prestidigitations* include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.','1sa','10 ft.',7,'10','','1 hr','see text','No',5,0,NULL,NULL),

The wall\'s maximum proportions are 4feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level.

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on.

Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack,for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (includeing enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The pro tection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the wouldbe controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded crea ture.Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect.

These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eve can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they\'re small and difficult to spot.Each eve is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18(+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30feet with perfect maneuverability,and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15)and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog,and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch. When you create the eyes, you specify instructions vou want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know,for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well A sample command:*Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures. The phrase Surround me directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn\'t trigger an eye\'s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring. Another sample command: Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight,and then return. The phrase Spread out directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.However, vour link with the eve is such that vou won\'t know if the eye was de stroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small por tion of the creature\'s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature\'s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete.When the body is ready, the subject is rein carnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed.Its class. base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject\'s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject\'s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can\'t be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. It\'s possible for the change in the subject\'s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, the DM should create a similar table of creatures of the same type or simply choose the new form. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can\'t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can\'t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><html><body><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>d%</td><td>Incarnation</td><td>Str</td><td>Dex</td><td>Con</td></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>Bugbear</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>02-13</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>14-25</td><td>Elf</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Gnoll</td><td>+4</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>27-38</td><td>Gnome</td><td>2</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>39-42</td><td>Goblin</td><td>2</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>43-52</td><td>Half-elf</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>53-62</td><td>Half-orc</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>63-74 Halfling</td><td>2</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>75-89 Human</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>90-93 Kobold</td><td></td><td>4</td><td>+2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>94</td><td>Lizardfolk</td><td>+2</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>95-98</td><td>Orc</td><td>+4</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td>Troglodyte</td><td>+0</td><td>2</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>Other (DM\'s choice)</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>?</td></tr></table></body></html></div> The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor,natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesnt automatically speak the language of the new form.

In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5.foot window were centered on the rope The window is present on the Material Plane, but it\'s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can\'t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Note: It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake\'s strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released,either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spel ends. The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical.A dispel magic can remove the sigil.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can\'t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It\'s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d101,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you)are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save), Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.','1sa','Touch',1,NULL,'','1 hr(D)','Will neg','Yes',5,5,NULL,NULL),

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled. The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action.The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.

Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example,a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. while soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone,cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.

Thus, a charn person spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a fireball could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spel turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through.For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by an inflict critical wounds spell (a 4th-level spell),you would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage.

In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs.

It strikes the opponent vou designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality.The weapon always strikes from your direction.It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.Your feats such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round\'s target.On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell\'s range, not the weapon\'s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon\'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10+ size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 +caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it.If the weapon is successfully resisted, the SPELLS CHAPTER II: spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity\'s own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.

(2357,'Symbol of Death','Triggered rune slays nearby creatures.','This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When trig.gered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Cover ing or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune,passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can\'t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions,such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death\'s triggering conditions cannot be changed. In this case, *reading the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.You can\'t use a symbol of death offensively;for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\'s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\'t qualify. For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\'s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of crea tures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An crase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.

(2377,'Telekinesis','Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.','You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle.sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short,violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25pounds per caster level (maximum 375pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example,a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don\'t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your In telligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn\'t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375pounds at 15th level). You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder). Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)','1sa','Long',5,NULL,'','[c]->1 rds*','Will neg(o), None*','Yes(o)*',5,5,NULL,NULL),

(2382,'Teleport','Instantly transports you as far as 100 miles.','This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\'t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can\'t simply teleport to the warlord\'s tent if you don\'t know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what\'s in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works.Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: Very familiar is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you\'ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. Seen casually is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. False destination is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy\'s sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if vou are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground). When traveling to a false destination,roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target You appear where you want to be. Off Target You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target. That\'s 18 miles, in this case. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area You wind up in an area that\'s visually or thematically similar to the target area. A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard\'s laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell\'s range,the spell simply fails instead.. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled.You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which vou are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane. The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally,you need to mark the circle in some way,such as by placing it on a raised platform. Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A rogue only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it.

Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

(2441,'Transmute Rock to Mud','Transforms 2 10-ft. cubes.','This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud.Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep,reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a 2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud. Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell since transmute rock to mud can\'t affect worked stone and doesn\'t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substancebut not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun,wind, and normal drainage.\nArcane Material Component Clay and water.','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','Perm*','see text','No',5,4,NULL,NULL),

The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance (an oak tree one hundred miles due north of here), and the transport via plants spel moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired (the oak tree outside your druid grove, for instance), but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\'t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. You can\'t use this spell to travel through plant creatures such as shambling mounds and treants.

(2446,'Trap the Soul','Imprisons subject within gem.','Trap the soul forces a creature\'s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways. Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature\'s name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful,the gem shatters. Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature\'s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature\'s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save. Material Component Before the actual casting of trap the soul, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 HD creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)\nFocus (Trigger Object Only): If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.','1a*','Close',3,NULL,'','Perm*','see text','Yes*',5,8,NULL,NULL),

To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected.

By moving into an oak tree (for exampleyou instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into.

This means that in a thick oak forest, a 10th-level druid could make ten transports over the course of 10 rounds, traveling as far as 30.o00 feet about 6 miles) in doing so. Each transport is a full-round action. You can,at vour option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends.

True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises,spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.

In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force. The caster can form the wall into a flat,vertical plane whose area is up to one 10foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails. Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

(2563,'Wall of Ice','Creates wall of hemisphere that can trap creatures inside.','This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects).Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice ap pears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high,or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,o0o square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor,while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save). Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3feet + 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7thlevel caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisvhere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

(2564,'Wall of Iron','0 hp; can topple onto foes.','You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall\'s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

(2575,'Wall of Stone','Creates a stone wall that can be shaped.','This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It is typically employed to close passages,portals, and breaches against opponents. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall\'s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use,if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell\'s area by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.

(2576,'Wall of Thorns','Thorns damage anyone who tries to pass.','A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human\'s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thoms takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature\'s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher,without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall. You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wal as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effecr on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its wav through the barrier Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed)For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spel when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside.In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free,or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes. Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.','1sa','Med',4,NULL,'','10 min(D)','None','No',5,5,NULL,NULL),

The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points-floor and ceiling, opposite walls,or the likeor else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won\'t cause you to become entangled. Anyone in the effect\'s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled,but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can\'t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check),a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10 If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150). The strands of a web spell are flammable.A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easilv as a hand brushes away cobwebs.Any fire-a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword. and so forth-can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Directing the cyclone\'s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell\'s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds-possibly endangering you or your alliesand then dissipates.(You can\'t regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on vour turn with no save allowed.

The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. (It can\'t pass through walls, for instance.) A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round,or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability, Wind walkers are not inyisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog.vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above,you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell\'s duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet) though it may descend faster if it wishes.

Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A gianr-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures), While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter.

By simply speaking aloud you can alter reality to better suit you.Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can produce any one of the following effects Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.. Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it\'s of a prohibited school. Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it\'s of a prohibited school.Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value. Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item. Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous. so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score,and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example,you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead. Revive the dead.A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes,one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again.A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. Transport travelers.A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent\'s successful save, a foe\'s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend\'s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however,may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies, You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.) For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff\'s current owner.Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisioned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could live indefi nitely. Duplicated spells allow saves and spel resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). Material Component When a wish dup licates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component. XP CostThe minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5.00o XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,o0o XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item,plus an additional 5.ooo XP','1sa','see text',9,NULL,'','see text','see text','Yes',5,9,NULL,NULL),
