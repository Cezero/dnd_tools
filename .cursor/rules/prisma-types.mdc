**Prisma Types Requirements:**
1. ALWAYS import `Prisma` namespace: `import type { Prisma } from '@shared/prisma-client'`
2. Use `Prisma.ModelCreateInput` and `Prisma.ModelUpdateInput` for create/update operations
3. Let Prisma handle nested relationships automatically - don't manually manage them
4. Use Prisma types directly. Don't create aliases unless absolutely necessary
5. Don't create custom types that duplicate Prisma input types
6. Use Prisma's generated types as the single source of truth
7. For complex operations, use Prisma's nested input types (e.g., `RaceCreateNestedManyWithoutRaceInput`)
