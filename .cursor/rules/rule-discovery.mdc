description: Before making any changes, systematically discover and apply all relevant rules
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true

**Rule Discovery Process:**
1. Fetch all rules related to the feature/domain you're working on
2. Check for any "alwaysApply" rules that might be relevant
3. Examine existing codebase patterns in similar features
4. Apply ALL relevant rules together, not individually
5. Verify compliance with the complete rule set before proceeding
