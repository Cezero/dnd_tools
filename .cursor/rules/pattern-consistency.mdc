**Pattern Consistency Requirements:**
1. Before creating new types/interfaces, check how similar features handle them
2. Look for existing examples in the codebase that solve the same problem
3. Follow established naming conventions and structure patterns
4. If a pattern exists, use it; don't create new patterns unless necessary
5. Check for any refactor summaries or documentation about established patterns
